# Water Tank Problem

This project solves the **Water Tank Problem**, a classic algorithmic challenge where units of water trapped between blocks of varying heights are calculated based on their arrangement. The solution includes a visualization of the trapped water using SVG for better understanding.

Additionally, this project addresses the **Max Profit Problem**, determining the maximum profit achievable from a given set of data (e.g., stock prices).
